Cryptocurrencies
1.	Overview of the analysis:
•	The purpose of this assignment is to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for the Accountability Accounting Company.
•	To that, I used the principal components of PCA. These are the steps I followed:
 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results.
2.	Results:
•	Preprocessing the Data for PCA: Data was preprocessed to prepare for dimension reduction with PCA and clustering using K-Means
•	 Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA: The dimensions of the dataFrame were reduced to 3 principal components using the Principal Component Analysis algorithm (PCA). These dimensions were then placed in a new dataframe.

•	Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means: The Elbow curve was created to find the best value for K from the PCA dataframe.

•	Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results.

3.	Summary:
•	With my understanding of what unsupervised learning is used for, I was able to process data, cluster, reduce the dimensions, reduce the principal components using PCA. Finally used the 3D scatter plot to visualize my findings.
